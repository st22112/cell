fade then make hidden?


Ask character a question.
Character answers back.
Keyword displays behind character.
example:
	How do you feel when the other inmates make fun of you?
	I can't do or say anything back. I feel *weak*.
	The word "weak" apears behind silouette.

intro: (Transition by fading in and out text. Make text glow)
I'm an old man
My son is wanted for armed robbery
The police couldn't arrest my son
So they locked me up instead

Old man {
	How did you feel when other inmates make fun of you?
	I couldn't do or say anything back. I felt *weak*

	How did you feel that you couldn't afford bathing water?
	I felt *miserable* that I couldn't clean myself in this dirty cell

	How did you feel when the police made you parade naked to get bathing water?
	I have no choice but to strip to be able to clean myself. I felt *humiliated*

	How did you feel when the police locked you up for a crime you didn't do?
	I felt *helpless*. I couldn't do anything, they wouldn't listen to me. It was so unfair.
